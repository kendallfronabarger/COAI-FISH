COAI-FISH

This is a repo that allows for a look into the image identification code for a senior capstone project. The image identification code was produced by Kendall Fronabarger.
An Overview of this Repo

Foundational Files

    fish.zip
       A zip file of all the trout images used for this project.

Format and Exploration

    FISHAI(1)
        A notebook with foundational content regarding trout image identification going through the steps in formating the images and fitting the model. Those foundational conceps are later applied to the tensorlite version of the model.

    Fish_Classification_TensorFlow_Model_for_Android_App
        A notebook where the fish.zip files come into play and are key for creating the training data and testing data. Creates the tensor trout image idenfitication and accuracy prediction model, and allows for a tensorlite version of the model to be used.
